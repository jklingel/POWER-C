# POWER-C
This is my repository for various functions and tools for POWER C. POWER C is an old C development framework, running on Commodore C64 and C128 computers. The standard is pre C89 / ANSI C. POWER C comes with an editor, a compiler, a linker, and many object files.

A very important repository for POWER C is https://github.com/GroundhogGrafix/PowerC-C64-C128/tree/main/PowerC. 

See https://janklingel.de/2026/01/09/programming-c-on-the-c64-in-power-c/ for more information on POWER C.
